    "Ans: The underlying concept of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is to find the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between two or more classes of data. By using a technique known as the kernel trick, SVMs are able to project data into higher-dimensional space to find a separating hyperplane that maximizes the margin between two classes of data. SVMs are powerful tools for classification, regression, outlier detection, and other machine learning tasks."

    "A support vector is a vector in a vector space that, when added to the data set, can help optimize the performance of a supervised learning algorithm. Support vectors are used in machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines (SVMs) and support vector regression (SVR). The concept of a support vector is to find a hyperplane that best divides a dataset into classes. This hyperplane is known as the decision boundary, and the support vectors are the data points that are closest to it."
